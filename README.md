# [WIP] Semantic Deployments

This GitHub App will automatically create [deployment events](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/deployments/) and [releases](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/) with changelogs based on [conventional commits](http://conventionalcommits.org/) that are pushed to your repositories.
